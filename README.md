ReactiveUI examples

I easily forget stuff. This project will help me and hopefully it helps you too!

Other libraries used:
* [Mahapps](http://mahapps.com/) - unnecessary for ReactiveUI but looks better
* [Modern UI Icons](http://modernuiicons.com/)

Some lessons learned:
* NuGet - Splat
	* After installing ReactiveUI NuGet package, the Splat NuGet package needs to be updated.
