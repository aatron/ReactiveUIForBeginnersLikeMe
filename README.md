ReactiveUI examples

I easily forget how to bind in ReactiveUI. This project is a reminder for me to remember how to bind to a variety of things. Hopefully it helps you also.

Other libraries used:
* [Mahapps](http://mahapps.com/) - unnecessary for ReactiveUI but looks better
* [Modern UI Icons](http://modernuiicons.com/)
